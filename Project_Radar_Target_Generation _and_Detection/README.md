# Radar Target Generation and Detection

This project utilizes Matlab to explore frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and associated post-processing techniques. The key topics covered include:

* Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and 2D FFT
* Distinguishing between clutter and targets
* Optimizing chirp bandwidth to meet system requirements for range resolution
* Phased array beam steering for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation
* Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) noise suppression
* Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis and dynamic thresholding
