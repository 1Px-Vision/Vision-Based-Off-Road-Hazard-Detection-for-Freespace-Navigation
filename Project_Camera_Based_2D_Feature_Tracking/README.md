# Project: Camera-Based 2D Feature Tracking

This project is the second in a series for Udacity's Sensor Fusion Nanodegree, focusing on the following key concepts:

* Utilizing ring buffers to manage memory efficiently when processing sequences of images
* Implementing keypoint detectors including Shi-Tomasi, Harris, FAST, BRISK, ORB, AKAZE, and SIFT
* Extracting and matching keypoint descriptors using methods such as FLANN and k-NN
* 
These techniques lay the groundwork for the subsequent step: estimating time-to-collision.

# Visualization of the results

Keypoints visualized with SIFT detectors, indicating keypoint size and orientation.
