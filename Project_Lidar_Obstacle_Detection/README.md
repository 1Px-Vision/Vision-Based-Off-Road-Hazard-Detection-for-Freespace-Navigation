# Project: Lidar Obstacle Detection

## Lidar and the Point Cloud Library (PCL)
This project is the first in a series for Udacity's Sensor Fusion Nanodegree, focusing on key concepts such as:

* Real-time processing of Lidar point clouds
* Ground plane segmentation using the RANSAC Algorithm
* Euclidean distance clustering with K-D tree data structures

Additional topics covered include:
* Point cloud simulation through raycasting
* Voxel grid filtering and processing

## Included in this repository 

* The code used to Lidar environment.cpp with the modifications
* src directory with code cpp the control LiDAR
* Files describing all the packages required to set up the environment
* This README.md file

## Visualization of the results
